Live site <em>Nature Escapes</em> hosted by GitHub Pages here: https://andscowal.github.io/nature/

Sometimes we get a little stressed and we do different things to try to get rid of it.
Me personally, I like to look at nature and that's exactly what this site does. 
It's a slideshow of photos organized by nature themes.
<br />Enjoy!

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
